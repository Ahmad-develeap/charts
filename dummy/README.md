# Dummy Helm Chart
This is a skeleton Helm Chart that is meant help you organize your files when starting a new chart.

It is based on the [MariaDB chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/mariadb) provided by the [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes) project.  

Copy this directory to get started with your new chart.
